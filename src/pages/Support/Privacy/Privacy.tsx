              want us to delete all information about you, in which case we will respect your wishes);we use the
              personal information on the basis of legitimate interest and we find that, following your objection, we do
              not have an overriding interest in continuing to use it; the personal information was unlawfully obtained
              or used; or to comply with a legal obligation. Please note, the right to have your data erased is not
              absolute. We may have legal reasons to retain your information. For example, where we are required to
              retain it in order to comply with a legal obligation, where it has been truly anonymised, or where we
              might need it to defend or commence legal proceedings.
