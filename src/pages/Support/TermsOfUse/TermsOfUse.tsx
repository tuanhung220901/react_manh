        </div>
        <div>
          Where we make a claim such as “You could get up to $1,000 more”, this is based on an analysis between the
          highest and lowest offers from our Car Buying Partners across a large sample of enquiries, ensuring a
          significant proportion of customers achieve a variance of at least this figure if selecting the highest offer
          over the lowest.
        </div>
        <div>
          Comparison pricing data analysed always excludes offers from scrap or recycling firms, so that offers are
          compared on a ‘full value’ basis.
        </div>
        <div>
          Any claims relating to this research are subject to change over time and variance in samples. Research and
